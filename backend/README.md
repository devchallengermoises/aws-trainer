## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop
- Docker Compose

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/quiz-api.git
cd quiz-api
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up -d
```

Then run:

docker exec -it quiz-laravel bash
php artisan tinker
$user = \App\Models\User::find(1);
$token = $user->createToken('frontend')->plainTextToken;

 Save the token you will need it to connect the FE and BE
```

### Redis
We use Redis to:
- Store quiz session data
- Maintain progress and answer order per user

---

## ðŸ“‚ Structure Highlights
- `routes/api.php` â†’ All API routes (protected by Sanctum)
- `app/Services/QuizSessionStore.php` â†’ Redis-based session logic
- `app/Http/Controllers/QuizController.php` â†’ Quiz logic (start, fetch question, answer, finish)

---

## ðŸ”’ Authentication
- Login with `/api/login`
- Uses Laravel Sanctum and cookie-based auth
